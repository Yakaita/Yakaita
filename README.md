### Hi there I'm Jeremy

I dropped out of college because of Covid and never went back.

I really only still code because [@kiranhart](https://github.com/kiranhart) codes and it inspires me to once again get a big idea that I give up on minutes into starting.

The only time I can actively program for more than 5 minutes is when its for a completely useless spreadsheet.

My code usually works but its like you took an Uber from your house to the train station so that you could take an Uber from the train station to your house.

### Life Tasks

[^yes]: She did in fact say yes

[^2]: Does my $2 win count?
